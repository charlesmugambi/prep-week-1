    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I studied programming in <strong>Moringa School</strong> after finishing high school at <em>Anester Boys</em> I have been coding for the past 6 months.
        I decided to study prograamming since I realized that i am constantly surrounded by 'code'.I wanted to be able to understand my surroundings.
        The knowledge I will gain from programming will set me ahead of others in the job market giving me beter chances compared to others.
